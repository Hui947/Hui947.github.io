excerpt: 'Ifit2, an interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2, plays a critical role in restricting neurotropic murine β-coronavirus RSA59 infection. RSA59 intracranial injection of Ifit2 deficient (-/-) compared to wild type (WT) mice results in impaired acute microglial activation, associated with reduced CX3CR1 expression, which consecutively limits migration of peripheral lymphocytes into the brain, leading to impaired virus control followed by severe morbidity and mortality. While the protective role of Ifit2 is established for acute viral encephalitis, less is known about its influence on demyelination during the chronic phase of RSA59 infection. Our current study demonstrates that Ifit2 deficiency causes extensive RSA59 viral spread throughout both the spinal cord grey and white matter and is associated with impaired CD4 + T cell infiltration. Cervical lymph nodes of RSA59 infected Ifit2 -/- mice showed reduced activation of CD4 + T cells and impaired IFNγ expression during acute encephalomyelitis. Furthermore, blood-brain-barrier integrity was preserved in the absence of Ifit2 as evidenced by integral, tight junction protein ZO-1 expression surrounding the meninges and blood vessels and decreased Texas red dye uptake. In contrast to WT mice exhibiting only sparse myelin loss, the chronic disease phase in Ifit2-/- mice was associated with severe demyelination and persistent viral load, even at low infection doses. Overall, our study highlights that Ifit2 provides antiviral functions by promoting acute neuroinflammation and thereby aiding virus control and limiting severe demyelination.'
