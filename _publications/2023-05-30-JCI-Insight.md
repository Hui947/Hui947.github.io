excerpt: 'Intratumoral heterogeneity is a defining hallmark of glioblastoma, driving drug resistance and ultimately recurrence. Many somatic drivers of microenvironmental change have been shown to affect this heterogeneity and, ultimately, the treatment response. However, little is known about how germline mutations affect the tumoral microenvironment. Here, we find that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs755622 in the promoter of the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is associated with increased leukocyte infiltration in glioblastoma. Furthermore, we identified an association between rs755622 and lactotransferrin expression, which could also be used as a biomarker for immune-infiltrated tumors. These findings demonstrate that a germline SNP in the promoter region of MIF may affect the immune microenvironment and further reveal a link between lactotransferrin and immune activation.'
