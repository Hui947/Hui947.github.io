excerpt: 'Although microRNA-7 (miRNA-7) is known to regulate proliferation of cancer cells by targeting Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ERBB) family, less is known about its role in cardiac physiology. Transgenic (Tg) mouse with cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of miRNA-7 was generated to determine its role in cardiac physiology and pathology. Echocardiography on the miRNA-7 Tg mice showed cardiac dilation instead of age-associated physiological cardiac hypertrophy observed in non-Tg control mice. Subjecting miRNA-7 Tg mice to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) resulted in cardiac dilation associated with increased fibrosis bypassing the adaptive cardiac hypertrophic response to TAC. miRNA-7 expression in cardiomyocytes resulted in significant loss of ERBB2 expression with no changes in ERBB1 (EGFR). Cardiac proteomics in the miRNA-7 Tg mice showed significant reduction in mitochondrial membrane structural proteins compared to NTg reflecting role of miRNA-7 beyond the regulation of EGFR/ERRB in mediating cardiac dilation. Consistently, electron microscopy showed that miRNA-7 Tg hearts had disorganized rounded mitochondria that was associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings show that expression of miRNA-7 in the cardiomyocytes results in cardiac dilation instead of adaptive hypertrophic response during aging or to TAC providing insights on yet to be understood role of miRNA-7 in cardiac function.'
